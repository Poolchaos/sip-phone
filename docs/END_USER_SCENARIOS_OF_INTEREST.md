# Scenarios of Interest

## Multiple Chrome Profiles, ZaiCommunicator profile not active

Use has many Chrome profiles (A and B). ZaiCommunicator is running on B. User closes down all windows using profile B, and is on A (e.g. a personal profile). If they are still logged in, calls will still be routed to them. The only GUI information is the Chrome Notification for Incoming Call, which disappears after about 10 seconds if not actioned.
